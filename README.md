# Tellybuddy
Tellybuddy is a traditional e-commerce system simulating a telco company which consists of a management client and a consumer facing client, both integrated together to a single common backend.

This repository consists of the following:
- Java EE 7 Backend (EJB)
- Management Web Client (JSF), powered with PrimeFaces 7.0 UI Component Library
- RESTful Web Services

The other consumer facing web client made with AngularJS can be found <a href="https://github.com/browleless/TellybuddyAngular">here.</a>
